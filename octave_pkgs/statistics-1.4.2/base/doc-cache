 -- cloglog (X)
     Return the complementary log-log function of X.

     The complementary log-log function is defined as

          cloglog (x) = - log (- log (X))

 -- T = crosstab (X, Y)
     Create a cross-tabulation (contingency table) T from data vectors.

     The inputs X, Y must be vectors of equal length with a data type of
     numeric, logical, or char.

     Currently, only 1- and 2-dimensional tables are supported.

logit

 -- logit (P)
     Compute the logit for each value of P

     The logit is defined as

          logit (P) = log (P / (1-P))

     See also: probit, logistic_cdf.

 -- [P, Y] = ppplot (X, DIST, PARAMS)
     Perform a PP-plot (probability plot).

     If F is the CDF of the distribution DIST with parameters PARAMS and
     X a sample vector of length N, the PP-plot graphs ordinate Y(I) = F
     (I-th largest element of X) versus abscissa P(I) = (I - 0.5)/N.  If
     the sample comes from F, the pairs will approximately follow a
     straight line.

     The default for DIST is the standard normal distribution.

     The optional argument PARAMS contains a list of parameters of DIST.

     For example, for a probability plot of the uniform distribution on
     [2,4] and X, use

          ppplot (x, "uniform", 2, 4)

     DIST can be any string for which a function DIST_CDF that
     calculates the CDF of distribution DIST exists.

     If no output is requested then the data are plotted immediately.

     Return the probit (the quantile of the standard normal
     distribution) for each element of P.

 -- [Q, S] = qqplot (X, Y)
 -- [Q, S] = qqplot (X, DIST)
 -- [Q, S] = qqplot (X, Y, PARAMS)
 -- qqplot (...)
     Perform a QQ-plot (quantile plot).

     If F is the CDF of the distribution DIST with parameters PARAMS and
     G its inverse, and X a sample vector of length N, the QQ-plot
     graphs ordinate S(I) = I-th largest element of x versus abscissa
     Q(If) = G((I - 0.5)/N).

     If the sample comes from F, except for a transformation of location
     and scale, the pairs will approximately follow a straight line.

     If the second argument is a vector Y the empirical CDF of Y is used
     as DIST.

     The default for DIST is the standard normal distribution.  The
     optional argument PARAMS contains a list of parameters of DIST.
     For example, for a quantile plot of the uniform distribution on
     [2,4] and X, use

          qqplot (x, "unif", 2, 4)

     DIST can be any string for which a function DISTINV or DIST_INV
     exists that calculates the inverse CDF of distribution DIST.

     If no output arguments are given, the data are plotted directly.

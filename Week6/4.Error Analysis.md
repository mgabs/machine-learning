# Error Analysis

$m_{cv} = 500$ examples in cross validation set
Algorithm mis-classifies 100 emails.

Manually examine the 100 errors, and categorize them based on:
1. What type of email it is
1. What cues (features) you think would have helped the algorithm classify them correctly.


# Types of Errors
1. Percentage Accuracy
2. Precision / Recall:
  $ Precision= \frac{True_positives}{ predicated_positives}
  =   \frac{True_positives}{True_positives + False_positives}$
  $ Recall = \frac{True_positives}{ Actual_positives}
  =   \frac{True_positives}{True_positives + False_negatives}$
3. Trading off precision and recall
  * If we want to predict that the patient has cancer only if we're very confident that they really do.
    $y = 1$ if $h(x) >= 0.7$
    $y = 0$ if $h(x) < 0.7$

    we'll tell someone they have cancer only if we think there's a greater than or equal to, 70% chance that they have cancer.
    > High precision, low recall

  * Suppose that, when in doubt, we want to predict that y=1.
  So, when in doubt, we want to predict that they have cancer so that at least they look further into it, and these can get treated in case they do turn out to have cancer.
    $y = 1$ if $h(x) >= 0.3$
    $y = 0$ if $h(x) < 0.3$
    > Low precision, high recall
4. F1 Score (F Score)
  Choosing the P & R that maximizes the Precision and Recall.
  $F_1 Score = 2 \frac {PR}{P+R}$
